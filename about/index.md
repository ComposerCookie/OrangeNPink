<p> Hi! Welcome to Orange & Pink! My name is Jacqueline and this is my personal blog where I write about stuffs that I care about like tech, feminism and my own personal experiences regarding the world. Aside from that, I also share fashions and random misc that I find to be interesting. I uh, for a lack of better word, am obsessed with charmanders, and love rather very geeky things like Star Trek, Stargate and Twilight Zone. Just like most other blogs, my blog is biased and is just my personal opinion (though I try to be as objective as possible), so please read with skeptical eyes and don't let my what I think influence you. I hope you enjoy what I write and thank you for reading my blog! <img class="blogEmoji" src= " {{ "/images/logoEmoji.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }} " width="32px" height="32px"> <img class="blogEmoji" src= " {{ "/images/faceEmoji.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }} " width="32px" height="32px">
